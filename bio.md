## What I'm doing now
Since September 2021 I doing my PhD in History and Philosophy of Science at the <a href="https://pencelab.be/" target="_blank">Pence Lab</a> at the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium.

I study how the concept of ‘biodiversity’ is operationalised outside the sciences, namely how different communities of actors (scientific advocacy groups, policy-makers, NGO’s, local communities) understand and manage the biodiversity crisis. I am particularly interested in the knowledge circulation between science and politics, and the transformations in the meaning of the ‘biodiveristy’ concept.

My PhD is part of a larger HPS project that aims at clarifying the '<a href="https://blog.pencelab.be/2021/mapping-and-responding-to-taxonomic-disorder/" target="_blank">Taxonomic Disorder</a>' in conservation biology.  

## The previous thing I did
In 2020 I graduated with Cum Laude from the research master History and Philosophy of Science at Utrecht University. My master dissertation is a history of 1970s molecular research. In a nutshell, what I wrote was a history of the identity of the molecular scientist — the ethical, social, political, and epistemic commitments as told and negotiated in the magazine _Nature_ as a sort of forum for self-reflection and self-construction. I studied the history of 1) the commercialization of laboratory materials; 2) science policy and of the concept of 'social responsibility' of scientists; and 3) workplace safety and research ethics in the context of the debates over the safety of recombinant DNA technology. The title of the dissertation is ‘To be a molecular scientist. The negotiation of epistemic and social virtues in 1970s _Nature_’s marketplace’. The research and writing processes were fun and challenging. One of the most enjoyable chapters to write was one in which I investigated what I called 'scientific advertisements' in _Nature_. These were ads for laboratory devices, and I was mostly interested in those targeting molecular biologists, so I looked at ads for microscopes, enzymes, cell-counters, freezers, but also for free catalogues and user manuals. I argued that by looking at the advertisement as a commercial visual object, we get a glimpse of _what it was like to be_ a molecular scientist. If you are curious, the full text is available in Open Access at the <a href="https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/400784" target="_blank">Student Theses Archive</a> of Utrecht University.  

## Just a bit further back
Before studying History and Philosophy of Science, I had studied an MSc in Neuroscience in Strasbourg and a BSc in Biological Sciences in Maastricht. But for a long time, I think I had always been interested in how people communicate within and about science. In the big-picture, I want to understand how knowledge is (and isn't) politically put into effect. The theme of communication of knowledge is deeply embedded in the practices of sciences, such as how researchers read, write, and commercialise research objects.
