### Biodiversity PhD project, and opening my personal knowledge-in-the-making
See my [bio](https://www.oliviodare.com/bio.html#what-im-doing-now) for a few lines on the project itself.

One of my aims in my PhD is making my research process transparent and open. Open Science has made the rounds as the new research ethos of some branches of science, and has specially been taken up in the natural sciences, specially those dealing with quantitative experimentation. I want to contribute to making the humanities more open too –not in the same way, of course, but reappropiating tools and ideas from the natural sciences and fitting them to my needs. Concretely, I have a sort of <a href="https://github.com/oliviodare/MakingKnowledge" target="_blank">'open lab book' on GitHub</a>, with annotations of my readings and the interpretations of sources. It's still an evolving project, and I still haven't figured out what is the best way to present all of it. If you have any ideas or experience with (humaities) open lab books, please get in touch! I am using a (not very refined) Zettelkasten method to take notes, making my notes 'atomistic'. This means that individual notes contain only one idea, claim, or concept (for example, the one called '<a href="https://github.com/oliviodare/MakingKnowledge/blob/main/making%20lists%20is%20a%20precondition%20and%20one%20of%20the%20initial%20steps%20of%20practices%20of%20conservation.md" target="_blank">making lists is a precondition and one of the inital steps of practices of conservation</a>') and that they are connected with other notes (the note in the example above is connected with '<a href="https://github.com/oliviodare/MakingKnowledge/blob/main/one%20of%20the%20main%20issues%20of%20conservation%20biology%20is%20dealing%20with%20funding,%20which%20is%20dealt%20with%20by%20setting%20'conservation%20priorities'.md" target="_blank">one of the main issues of conservation biology is dealing with funding, which is dealt with by setting 'conservation priorities'</a>'). The idea is to have a large network of very connected simple notes, which helps to draw relations between ideas and help in creating new ones. The network, as well as the individual notes, change over time, which I think it's very interesting and useful. Knowledge-making is a dynamic process, so it's worth exploring how representation of knowledge can be also dynamic and adaptable.  


### Journal (and Center) of Trial and Error
I am involved, curious, sceptical, and hopeful (?) about the movement of Open Science, motivated specially by its possibility to exert fertile political change. In the context of the Dutch OS scence –which is big– I got enthusiastic enough to start and develop with other madmen the <a href="https://www.jtrialerror.com/" target="_blank">*Journal of Trial and Error*</a>. JOTE, for short, is a project that explores how far can collectives push for transparency - and its limits, its drawbacks, and its necessary successes. We wanted to change the way academics think of success and failure, but we didn't want simply to sell a story of failure-as-a-precondition-of-success. We wanted people to see how competitive research has gotten and the effects that such environment.

As its ~~current~~ Creative Director, I coordinate*d* the communication strategy, journal design, and development of the digital infrastructures. 

***Journal --> Center***
At the moment, we are busy turning the Journal into a Center. Our activities go beyond publishing a yearly journal – out team has grown to more than a dozen researchers and are involved in **teaching** (currently designing a course on the history, sociology and philosophy of academic publishing at Utrecht University and a seminar on the philosophy of the scientific method at Heidelberg University), **publishing** (partners of [Open Publishing Press from Tilburg University](https://openpresstiu.pubpub.org/)), **hosting events** (see the [debate](https://www.jtrialerror.com/debate/) we organised on transparency metrics and OS rankings), and other kinds of partnerships (e.g., with the [De Nieuwe Utrechtse School](https://www.jtrialerror.com/collaborations#dnus). In short, we are more than a publishing platform and the Journal of Trial and Error is part of a larger digital community engaged in rethinking academic success.
