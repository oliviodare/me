### Journal (and Center) of Trial and Error
I am involved, curious, and sceptical, and hopeful (?) about the movement of Open Science, motivated specially by its possibility to exert fertile political change. In the context of the Dutch OS scence –which is big– I got enthusiastic enough to start and develop with other madmen the [Journal of Trial and Error](https://www.jtrialerror.com/). JOTE, for short, is a project that explores how far can collectives push for transparency - and its limits, its drawbacks, and its necessary successes. We wanted to change the way academics think of success and failure, but we didn't want simply to sell a story of failure-as-a-precondition-of-success. We wanted people to see how competitive research has gotten.

As its ~~current~~ Creative Director, I coordinate*d* the communication strategy, journal design, and development of the digital infrastructures. I am most proud of having put into words the journal's mission: _In science, there is a gap between what is researched and what is published. The _Journal of Trial and Error_ (JOTE) aims to close that gap_.
