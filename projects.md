Together my [PhD research project](bio.html#what-i-am-doing-now), I'm involved the following side adventures:


## *reading, listening, and reading*. A collective walk on how we read and listen to the environment, history, and each other.

'Reading, listening, and reading' is an interactive installation in the form of a collective walk around sound devices. Conference participants hear the voices of fellow colleagues in environmental history (and neighbouring fields) speaking of their **intimate practices of reading and listening**. We will hear how they read a source, read a colleague's book, actively listen to a witness, or read changes and conflicts in the landscape. The collection of voices is embedded in a mixed-media dispositif: voices, texts, images, and diagrams will serve to create a warm and sensorial space. The guiding thread is to explore how what we read in our environment is **mediated by** the variety of reading practices themselves. This installation is a proof of concept on how artistic practices can serve as methodologies in the ambition to re-think how we share our research beyond conventional academic formats.

This installation has been developed by Brussels-based duo: <a class="dont-break-out" href="https://quand-ils-parlent.jimdofree.com/" target="_blank">Alicia Jeannin</a> (spoken-word audiovisual artist, performer and scenographer) and Max Bautista Perpinyà.

Our installation will premiere at the 4th World Congress of Environmental History in Oulu (Finland), 19-23 August 2024 <a class="dont-break-out" href="https://wceh2024.com/" target="_blank">https://wceh2024.com/</a>. 

*reading, listening, and reading* has been awarded the European Union's Culture Moves Europe mobility grant.
