# Hello, my name is Max.
  
Welcome to this small Github repository, which now acts as my website. My name is Max Bautista Perpinyà and I am a PhD researcher in the history of science, based in UCLouvain, in Belgium.

On these pages, you'll find a sort of open CV. The basic structure is this:

- my [bio](bio.md).
- the [projects](projects.md) I am working on.
- a [list](pubs.md) of the academic publications and journalistic pieces I've written, the talks I've given, and events I hosted.
- my actual <a href="https://oliviodare.github.io/cv/" target="_blank">CV</a>.
